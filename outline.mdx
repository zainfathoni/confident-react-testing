# Outline

- Intro
- Problems
  - Humans make mistakes
  - New features tend to introduce regressions
  - Machines don't make mistakes, ~~do they~~?
- Solution
  - Testing
  - Code vs Code: test code against implementation code
- Introducing [The Test User](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user)
  - 3 users of our components:
    - End User --> user interactions, i18n, a11y, etc.
    - Developer --> props, context, side effects, etc.

- Comparison
  - Emphasis common mistakes:
    - Assert component instance's state
    - Call component instance method directly
  - Why?
    - Avoid testing implementation details <-- "aha" moment
- Recap
  - [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)
  - Avoid [testing implementation details](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details)
  - Test interfaces instead
    - Props
    - Rendered DOM
